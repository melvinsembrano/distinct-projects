### Distinct Projects – VS Code Extension

**Make every project visually unique at a glance**

Distinct Projects lets you assign a custom title bar color to each workspace or folder in VS Code. No more guessing which project you're in when you have multiple windows open — give your React frontend a vibrant blue, your backend API a deep purple, your documentation repo a calm green, or your client work a bold red. Instantly recognizable, even from across the room.

#### Key Features
- Per-workspace/folder custom title bar color (light & dark theme aware)
- Simple color picker in the status bar or via command palette
- Automatically applies the chosen color when the workspace is opened
- Colors are saved in workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`), so they travel with the project (great for teams or Git)
- Supports product icon theme title bars (works with the default title bar and most custom ones)
- Lightweight, no performance impact

#### Perfect for
- Developers juggling multiple projects daily
- Teams that want consistent visual identity across shared repositories
- Anyone who gets confused by identical-looking VS Code windows

#### How to use
1. Install **Distinct Projects** from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Open any folder or workspace.
3. Click the new color swatch in the status bar (or run `Distinct Projects: Choose Title Bar Color` from the Command Palette).
4. Pick your color using the color picker.
5. Done! The title bar instantly updates and will remember your choice every time you open this project.
